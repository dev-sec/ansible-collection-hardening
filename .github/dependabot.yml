# To get started with Dependabot version updates, you'll need to specify which
# package ecosystems to update and where the package manifests are located.
# Please see the documentation for all configuration options:

version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "pip"  # See documentation for possible values

    # by default Dependabot creates labels like "major" or "minor" for version updates of our deps.
    # however this interferes with the github changelog generator which uses these labels to define
    # a new version for the collection
